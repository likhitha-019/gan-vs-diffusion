# GAN vs Diffusion Models – Image Generation Playground

This repository contains Google Colab notebooks implementing and comparing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs* and **Diffusion Models** for image generation tasks. It includes visualizations, training outputs, and performance graphs.

## 📁 Notebooks

- **`gan.ipynb`**: Implementation of GANs for image generation using PyTorch in Colab.
- **`diffusionmodels.ipynb`**: Diffusion model implementation and training workflow.
- **`gandiffgraphs.ipynb`**: Visualization and comparison of results from GAN and Diffusion models.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: A neural network-based approach to generate realistic data using a generator-discriminator setup.
- **Diffusion Models**: Probabilistic models that iteratively denoise data, recently popularized for high-fidelity image generation.

## 📊 Features

- Side-by-side comparison of GANs and Diffusion model outputs.
- Graphs showing loss curves, sample generations, and model performance.
- Code modularity for reusability and extension.
- Google Colab friendly with GPU acceleration.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open the notebooks in Google Colab.
2. Make sure GPU is enabled (`Runtime > Change runtime type > GPU`).
3. Run each cell in order. Customize parameters for experiments.

## 📌 Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- torchvision
- tqdm
